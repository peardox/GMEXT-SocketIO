## GMEXT-SocketIO

This repo is a work in progress that re-creates the socket.io protocol in GML

As the socket.io protocol is in high use by web programmers using node as well as a mature and stable message-passing system it is desirable to have it available for one's own projects.

Some useful examples of what sockets.io would provide would be chat systems (your own Chat / micro-Discord, Lobbys etc), data passing for Multi-Player games and Binary package delivery for seamless project updates
